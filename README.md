## Mockup images

### Welcome Page
![Welcome page](images/mock-up/WelcomePage.png "Welcome page")
The "Welcome" Page introduces our site's visitors to the web site they have entered. Users must either login
or sign up to create their accounts in order to use the site.

![Dashboard page](images/mock-up/DashboardPage.png "Dashboard page")
Once the user is logged in, the dashboard displays all of the user's lists/to-do's and journals/notes that they've made.
Users may add a new list/to-do or journal/note if they'd like by clicking the **+** icon. Likewise, if they'd like
to delete their contents, they may also click the **Trash** icon. However, if the user wants to view or update an
existing property, they need to click the title (ie: Programming Bucket List, Woodworking Bucket List, or
04/01/2021 Journal Entry) to redirect to its own specific page.

![Menu bar](images/mock-up/MenubarPage.png "Menubar")
The menu bar only appears when the user is logged in. If the user clicks on the "hamburger" icon, this page displays
the options that the user is allowed to do, they can go to the dashboard, list/to-do, upload photo, journal/notes,
profile, settings, and log out.

![Notification modal](images/mock-up/NotificationModal.png "Notification modal")
The notification modal only appears when the user is logged in. The notification number is composed of the number
of how many notifications that have not dismissed by the user. 

There are 3 categories for the notification: Lists/To-Do, Journal/Notes, and Site Notification (where the admin
sends an important messages to everyone). The user can click "Dismiss" or "Dismiss all" to decrease the notification
number. Additionally, they can just close the modal by clicking "Close"
